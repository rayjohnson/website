Like many geeks I like to play around with home automation.  But the sad sad truth of it is that few solutions are very reliable or resilient.  They end up causing more pain than gain.  However, 
if you ignore the "smart" stuff there are some dumb things you can do that really work.

The thing I hate about technology at home is when it breaks.  I am tech support and home and when printers or smart home gadgets stop working I hear about it.  As a result I try to put in as little as possible and that which is adopted better be rock solid.

I know I'm not alone - I've had many friends show me some cool automation thing that had.  Like opening the garage door with their phone - only to have to call their wife to have them close the door manually because something went wrong.

The problem with many of the new and very cool home automation systems is they usually require wifi and/or cloud services.  If your wifi goes down your smart home is as dumb as a rock.

It is often said "the best technology disappears" - meaning it because something you never have to think about.  Well one of the best examples of that in home automation has to be the simple light sensing switch.  Motion sensor lights that turn on when you open a closet.  Or dusk-till-dawn lights that keep your garden or driveway light up at night but not during the day.

Also motion sensing lights have got more interesting as LED lights have improved.  Take for example the [Ashialight LED Motion Sensor Light Bulb](http://amzn.to/2hUZUcJ).  It has a motion sensor built right into what looks like an ordinary light bulb!  This is perfect for a closet or utility room.  You then may want to put a [Switch Guard](http://amzn.to/2i3GHpg) on the light switch so it doesn't accidentally get shut off.

There are three types of devices in this category.  1) Motion sensing is probably the most common, 2) Light sensing with dusk-to-dawn type lights, and 3) Sound sensing - which means the light comes on for a while when it hears sound.  I'd put the famous product of the 80's [The Clapper](http://amzn.to/2hTXknu) into this category.  Yes - they still sell [The Clapper](http://amzn.to/2hTXknu)!

The thing about these types of the products is that they work.  They are resilient and do not go down with your Wifi or ISP.  They do not have an on going service charge.  They are simple.  Frankly, if you are going to start doing home automation I dare say this is the place to start.
