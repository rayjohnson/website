I built this new blog with Hugo (http://gohugo.io).  It is a fairly new tool under active development that is already powerful and shows lot's of promise.

DRAFT

Hugo  is a framework written in Golang that builds static web sites.  By a "static" 
site - I mean there is no database.  Just html, css and java script files.  A static
site is easy to serve as pretty much all hosting and web servers out there can host
basic HTML sites.

Now I'm not the best person to give a full review of Hugo.  I'm not much of a blogger and this is the first time I've used any tool like this.  There are many other reviews like that out there worth checking out - try this one [here](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/static-website-generators-jekyll-middleman-roots-hugo-review/).

Rather, what I can saw as a newbie blogger - getting started with Hugo is really easy.   Just follow the quick start and you are good to go.  You do need to understand HTML and Git which any programmer would be able to do.  (If you have zero programming experience you may be better off with Wordpress of something along those lines.)

I am using Github pages to host my site - which is 100% free.  So, of course, that is a really nice option as well.  All you need is a Github account (also free) and then you publish you site into a specially named git repository in your account.  It is that simple.

The hardest part about learning Hugo was picking a theme.  There are dozens of themes and they have a nice gallery to choose from.  Unfortunately, since they are all community created some are much better than others.  I accidentally chose one that had a lot of issues at first.  My biggest nit is they gallery of themes should have a scoring mechanism or something to get insight into the quality of the themes.

Most of the themes use third party services to flesh out you site.  Again, if you have been blogging for a while you may know about these services - but if you are a newbie like me there is a little learning curve on understanding these additional services.  but it is worth it - they are powerful and provide many nice features.  Here are a few of them:

#### Google Analytics

Ok - this one you might have guessed existed.  Most of the themes in Hugo have support for Google Analytics (GA).  You can get your free Google Analytics account [here](https://www.google.com/analytics/).  You need to fill out information about your blog and get a Tracking ID.  Most themes have a place for you to specify your GA tracking id in your config.toml file and just like that you have very robust web site tracking!

#### Disqus

At its core Hugo
