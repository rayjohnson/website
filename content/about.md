<h4 class='text-center'>
    I am a software engineering executive.
    <br/>
    I build products, I build teams, I build business value!
</h4>

Hi!  I'm a SVP of Engineering currently living in sunny southern california.  I got my BS in Computer Science at George Washington University in D.C. and my Masters of Computer Science at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, GA.

Most recently I've worked at a fairly large company but also three different start-ups.  While I like to keep my hands dirty, I mostly spend my time building and managing teams of engineers, designers, quality assuance folks, and sometimes product and project managers.  But ,ost importantly I partner heavily with my peers in marketing and sales to make sure we are making products that do what the company and customers need!  You can check-out my LinkedIn profile if you want to know more.

I like to do some hacking on the side as well.  (Though with a couple of young children I never get to do that enough.)  Mostly I've been playing with stuff around home automation.
