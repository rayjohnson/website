<h4 class='text-center'>
    I am a software engineering executive.

    I build products, I build teams, I build business value!
</h4>

Hi!  I'm a SVP of Engineering currently living in sunny southern California.  I got my BS in Computer Science at George Washington University in D.C. and my Masters of Computer Science at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, GA.

Most recently I've worked at a fairly large company but also three different start-ups.  While I like to keep my hands dirty, I mostly spend my time building and managing teams of engineers, designers, quality assurance folks, and sometimes product and project managers.  But, most importantly I partner heavily with my peers in marketing and sales to make sure we are making products that do what the company and customers need!  You can check-out my LinkedIn profile if you want to know more.

I like to do some hacking on the side as well.  (Though with a couple of young children I never get to do that enough.)  Mostly I've been playing with stuff around home automation.

### Old Publications

I used to do more research oriented work which allowed me to publish a few things.  All of this is related to the Tcl/Tk scripting language that I used to work on:

*   While working at Sun Labs on the Tcl/Tk scripting language I wrote the [Tcl Style Guide](https://www.tcl.tk/doc/styleGuide.pdf) used by many folks using the Tcl scripting language.

*   I wrote a chapter in the book [Bots and other Internet Beasties](https://books.google.com/books/about/BOTS_and_Other_Internet_Beasties.html?id=0tdFAQAAIAAJ) in 1996.  It was about the Tcl/Tk scripting language and a little research I was doing using Tcl for executing content safely over the Internet.

*   USENIX Fifth Annual Tcl/Tk Workshop: [TclOSAScript - Exec for MacTcl](/papers/tclosascript.pdf)
*   USENIX Third Annual Tcl/Tk Workshop: [Cross Platform Support in Tk](/papers/portable-tk.pdf)
*   Tcl/Tk Conference in 1993: [Autonomous Knowledge Agents](/papers/tcl_93_rjohnson.pdf)
